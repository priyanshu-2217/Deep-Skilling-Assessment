Exercise 7: Financial Forecasting

ðŸ“Œ Goal:
Use a recursive function to predict future value based on past growth rate.

ðŸ§¾ Method Used:
Recursive function:
- Base Case: if years == 0 â†’ return current value
- Recursive Step: value * (1 + rate) â†’ for remaining years

ðŸ”¢ Example:
Initial Value = â‚¹10,000
Growth Rate = 10%
Years = 5
Output: â‚¹16,105.10

ðŸ§  Time Complexity:
- Without optimization: O(n), where n = number of years

âš¡ How to Optimize:
- Recursion is fine for small years (<= 10â€“20)
- Use **iteration or memoization** for large inputs to avoid stack overflow

ðŸš€ Alternative:
Use formula-based approach:
Future Value = P Ã— (1 + r)^n
