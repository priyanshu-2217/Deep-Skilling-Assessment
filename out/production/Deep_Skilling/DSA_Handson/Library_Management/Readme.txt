Exercise 6: Library Management System

ðŸ“Œ Goal:
Build a system where users can search for books by title using linear and binary search.

ðŸ§¾ Setup:
- Book.java: Contains bookId, title, and author
- Library.java: Stores books and provides search functionality

ðŸ›  Methods:
1. linearSearch(title) â†’ Loops through each book, checks title
2. binarySearch(title) â†’ Works only if the array is sorted by title

ðŸ§  Time Complexity:
- Linear Search: O(n)
- Binary Search: O(log n) (Only on sorted list)

âœ… When to Use What:
- Linear Search: Use when data is small or **unsorted**
- Binary Search: Use when data is **sorted**, and fast search is needed

ðŸ“Œ Note:
- Used `Arrays.sort()` to sort books alphabetically by title before binary search
