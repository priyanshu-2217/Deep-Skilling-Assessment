Exercise 3: Sorting Customer Orders

📌 Objective:
Sort customer orders by total price to prioritize high-value orders.

📁 Files:
- Order.java → Stores orderId, customerName, totalPrice
- SortOrders.java → Contains Bubble Sort and Quick Sort logic

🔄 Sorting Algorithms:
- Bubble Sort: Simple sorting by comparing each pair, time complexity O(n²)
- Quick Sort: Fast and efficient sorting using divide-and-conquer, time complexity O(n log n)

🧠 Comparison:
- Bubble Sort is slower for large data (O(n²))
- Quick Sort is faster and used in real-world applications (O(n log n))

✅ Conclusion:
Quick Sort is preferred for sorting large lists because it is faster and uses fewer comparisons.
