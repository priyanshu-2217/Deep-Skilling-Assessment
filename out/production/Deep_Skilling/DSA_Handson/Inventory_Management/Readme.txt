📌 Objective:
Build an inventory system to manage product details with add, update, delete, and view features.

📁 Classes Used:
- Product.java: Holds product details like ID, name, quantity, price.
- InventorySystem.java: Manages the inventory using a HashMap.

- HashMap is used to store and manage products using productId as key.

🕒 Time Complexity:
- Add Product: O(1)
- Update Product: O(1)
- Delete Product: O(1)
- View All: O(n)

🧠 Conclusion:
