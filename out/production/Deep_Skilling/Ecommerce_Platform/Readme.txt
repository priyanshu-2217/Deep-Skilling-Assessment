Exercise 2: E-commerce Platform Search Function

📌 Objective:
Implement linear and binary search for an e-commerce platform.

📁 Classes Used:
- Product.java: Defines product details.
- SearchDemo.java: Contains search methods and main function.

🔍 Algorithms:
- Linear Search: O(n), suitable for small unsorted data.
- Binary Search: O(log n), needs sorted data, better for large datasets.

for more detail:
| Search Type       | Best Case                    | Average Case  | Worst Case                               |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Linear Search | O(1) – match is at the start | O(n/2) → O(n) | O(n) – match is at end or not found      |
| Binary Search | O(1) – match is at middle    | O(log n)      | O(log n) – each step halves search space |


🧠 Conclusion:
Binary search is more efficient for large datasets but needs sorting.
